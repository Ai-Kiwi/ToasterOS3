How to use press home get to go into apps I will make wiki soon

to install run `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ai-Kiwi/ToasterOS3/main/installer.lua` then go install


if a werid bug happens and you don't boot into the os (most liklt because of core data lose) just run
`wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ai-Kiwi/ToasterOS3/main/installer.lua` then go repair



also note for devs if theres a file thats on this github but the installer doesn't dowload it its probs because im still working on it
